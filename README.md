## 73rd Legion Website

A Website project for me and my friends.  We want to build a website for our community of friends and
learn JS, React, Redux, etc. along the way.

# Requirements
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [PHP 7.0+](http://php.net/downloads.php)
- [Node.js and NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

# Installation
- First copy a .env.example to .env
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`

## Testing
To run a local web server to test things, run `php artisan serve`.

## Reminders
When developing on the front end don't forget to recompile your assets with either `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`,
otherwise you won't see your changes
